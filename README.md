# SOBERS Assignment

## Introduction

For this assignment, our client has a website that takes personal export of banking history and displays it in the frontend.
There is already a version that runs for a single bank.
But now you have the task to create a script that parses data from multiple banks.
In the future there, the client wants to add more banks.

## Assignment

You are tasked to create a script that will parse multiple CSV's and create a unified CSV.
There are three different CSV's, this will increase in the future.
The client has a hard requirement that the result is stored as a CSV file.
But JSON and XML will be used in the future, maybe even storing the result in a database.

In the data folder, there are three CSV's with banking data.
Since the CSV's come from different banks, the layout of data can differ.

Create a script according to above-specified requirements.
You are allowed to take as much time as needed, but try to manage your time to around 1 or 2 hours.
Since we are a Python shop, the script must be done with Python.

Scoring is based on:

- Correctness
- Code architecture
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Extendability
- Pythonicness of code

Tests are not required, but plus points for tests.
This is the moment to show your skills.
